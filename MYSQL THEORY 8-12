Answer-9: Normalization in the context of databases refers to the process of organizing and structuring data within a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency. The primary goal of normalization is to reduce the potential for anomalies in data (such as update, insertion, and deletion anomalies) and to improve data integrity by ensuring that the data is logically stored in a way that prevents unnecessary duplication.
Answer-10: In MySQL, a join is an operation that allows you to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Joins are essential in relational databases because data is often spread across multiple tables, and you need to combine that data in meaningful ways.

Each category serves a distinct purpose, and together they provide the full range of functionality needed to interact with a relational database.
